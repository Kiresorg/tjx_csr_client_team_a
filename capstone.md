### Day 2
* 

### Day 3

### Day 4

### Day 5

## Technology stack
* Backend 
    - (Express/Node.js) is required
    - The choice of additional Express middleware is unconstrained

    - insert picture of webpage
    - explain how many pages we have and what they do.

## Problems Worked Through
* Problem 1
    - How it was mitigated

* Problem 2
    - How it was mitigated  

## Application breadown
### Allow CSRs to be able to
* Authenticate themselves via a login mechanism
* Use CRUD operations for Orders including the ability to interactively add products from the Product catalog
* Save an Order as a draft
* Tie the order to a Customer
* Browse the product catalog (as a CSR adds or removes products from an order, the product count needs to be updated)
* Browse the customer database
* Track and change the shipping status of the order
 
 ## Contributors
* Our project consisted of two teams. The people working on specific sections of the app (API, DB, UI/UX, etc..) flushed out code skeletons and scripts for each team to then work with and create their own version of the order tracking app.
* Team A

* Team B
    - Lavon Burgo
